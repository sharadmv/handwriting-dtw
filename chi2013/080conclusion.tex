This paper presents a new type of user input for writing: given finger data from the LEAP Motion, identify characters and words that are written in the air. This problem is novel because no pen up/pen down gesture exists that determines the beginning and end of data. Rather, characters must be recognized in real time. We propose a data-based similarity search algorithm using dynamic time warping and its recent optimizations to do some simple matching. Future work will include extending the recognition algorithm to arbitrary gestures and the use of the LEAP Motion in different user scenarios than handwriting recognition. These include using a web browser, listening to music, and a replacement to the mouse and keyboard altogether.
