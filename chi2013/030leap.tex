Data will be recorded uses the LEAP motion, a commercial technology that captures precise data about the hands.

The LEAP Motion plugs into computers via USB and sends information about any hands it sees in its field of view, which is a cone of about 8 cubic feet above it.
It then determines the location of fingers within the field of view, the angle of the hand, the existence and position of any "tools," such as pens or pencils, and an approximation of the curvature of the palm.
This paper only uses the finger  and tool position data taken from the LEAP motion. The LEAP can capture these finger points at approximately 100 fps using USB 2.0 port or about 150 using a USB 3.0 port.
