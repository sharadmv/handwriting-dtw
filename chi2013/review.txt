The Meta-Review

   This authors present a new type of user input for writing. They use an
   existing/commercial motion device, which is designed to capture precise
   data about human hands, to collect finger data. Then, they identify
   characters and words that are written in the air. This proposed solution
   can be considered a new concept. The authors propose a data-based
   similarity search algorithm using dynamic time warping (with
   optimization) to perform matching.

   - One of the concerns of the reviewers is that there is not enough
   information to understand how the work is different, at its current
   state, from pen up/down gestures.

   - It is also perceived that snippets of time data series are fed into the
   algorithm but is not clear how the snippets would (in practice) be
   separated from a continuous stream of data.

   - It is not clear what is the content of the data used for the presented
   results.

   - There seems to be a mistake in the calculation of the size of the
   database. There are 30 words on the snippet of Lincoln's address, times
   100 people comes to 3000, not 30000 (unless the authors mean the complete
   address, which is not clearly stated).

   - In general the paper is very well written and the number of individuals
   contributing to dataset and samples provided by each individual is
   sufficiently large.

   - While the application indicated in the paper appears to track 2D hand
   gestures used to “write” characters very well, replicating keyboard &
   mouse functionality using hand gestures will require tracking in three
   dimensions. The authors should describe how the third dimension will
   increase complexity and processing times. This could be applied to sign
   language as well to assist computer interactions with disabled persons.

   - The poster is clear and simple to understand. The design is not
   particularly exciting but does the job well.

General Comments on the Extended Abstract

   The abstract is very well put together. No mention of specific computer
   vision device. The novelty of this paper is inherent in the tracking
   device. Paper would be better if more comparison between character
   recognition schemes done.

   Very nice colors and headings used. Good balance of images and words.

General Comments on the Extended Abstract

   There is not enough information to understand how the work is different,
   at its current state, from pen up/down gestures. It seems to me that
   snippets of time data series are fed into the algorithm but is not clear
   to me how the snippets would in practice be separated from a continuous
   stream of data. It is not clear what was the content of the data used for
   the presented results. Finally there seems to be a mistake in the
   calculation of the size of the database. There are 30 words on the
   snippet of Lincoln's address, times 100 people comes to 3000, not 30000.
   (unless you meant the complete address, which is not clearly stated).

   Very well written, highly relevant topic

   Number of individuals contributing to dataset and samples provided by
   each individual sufficiently large

   While the application indicated in the paper appears to track 2D hand
   gestures used to “write” characters very well, replicating keyboard &
   mouse functionality using hand gestures will require tracking in three
