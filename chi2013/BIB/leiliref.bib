	of interest no longer re- sembles a pizza box or a refrigerator,
	but a warehouse full of computers. These new large datacenters are
	quite different from traditional hosting facilities of earlier times
	and cannot be viewed simply as a collection of co-located servers.
	Large portions of the hardware and software resources in these facilities
	must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of Internet
	service performance, something that can only be achieved by a holistic
	approach to their design and deployment. In other words, we must
	treat the datacenter itself as one massive warehouse-scale computer
	(WSC). We describe the architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing
	their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics
	of their software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and
	programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core
	platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's WSCs
	on a single board.},

  edition = {1st ed. 2006. Corr. 2nd printing},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
	over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments
	in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian
	methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream,
	while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing
	and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability
	of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development
	of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational
	Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels
	have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
	This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
	providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
	and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
	PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous
	knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is
	assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear
	algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities
	would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
	introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
	courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
	processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive
	support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
	exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for
	a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while
	solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
	publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material,
	and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
	information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical
	aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include
	free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example
	data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant
	Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair
	in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow
	of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the
	Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
	Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

	problem in both memory use and computational time. To improve scalability,
	we have developed a parallel {SVM} algorithm ({PSVM}), which reduces

	and which loads only essential data to each machine to perform parallel
	computation. Let n denote the number of training instances, p the
	reduced matrix dimension after factorization (p is significantly
	smaller than n), and m the number of machines. {PSVM} reduces the

	time to O(np2=m). Empirical study shows {PSVM} to be effective. {PSVM}

	of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which
	yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization
	theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the
	square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
	of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent
	to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production
	of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations
	of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in
	a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions
	of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are
	approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles;
	curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle)
	have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature;
	at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced;
	the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal.
	The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement
	independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is
	successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand
	in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement
	organization are discussed.},

  edition = {Corrected},
  month = {July},
  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
	and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
	in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
	of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
	
	Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed
	with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas
	in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach
	is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.
	Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It
	should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested
	in data mining in science or industry.
	
	The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
	to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks,
	support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first
	comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
	
	Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
	of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
	in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
	models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
	of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
	curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
	of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
	is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
	and projection pursuit.
	
	FROM THE REVIEWS:
	
	TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates
	on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use
	them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As
	a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably
	be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

  abstract = {Modern applications such as Internet traffic, telecommunication records,
	and large-scale social networks generate massive amounts of data
	with multiple aspects and high dimensionalities. Tensors (i.e., multi-way
	arrays) provide a natural representation for such data. Consequently,
	tensor decompositions such as Tucker become important tools for summarization
	and analysis. One major challenge is how to deal with high-dimensional,
	sparse data. In other words, how do we compute decompositions of
	tensors where most of the entries of the tensor are zero. Specialized
	techniques are needed for computing the Tucker decompositions for
	sparse tensors because standard algorithms do not account for the
	sparsity of the data. As a result, a surprising phenomenon is observed
	by practitioners: Despite the fact that there is enough memory to
	store both the input tensors and the factorized output tensors, memory
	overflows occur during the tensor factorization process. To address
	this intermediate blowup problem, we propose Memory-Efficient Tucker
	(MET). Based on the available memory, MET adaptively selects the
	right execution strategy during the decomposition. We provide quantitative
	and qualitative evaluation of MET on real tensors. It achieves over
	1000X space reduction without sacrificing speed; it also allows us
	to work with much larger tensors that were too big to handle before.
	Finally, we demonstrate a data mining case-study using MET.},

	How to model such streams? How to simultaneously find patterns within

	through a general data model, tensor streams, and an effective algorithmic

	WTA, independent- window tensor analysis (IW) and moving-window tensor
	analysis (MW), are presented and evaluated extensively on real datasets.
	Finally, we illustrate one important application, multi-aspect correlation

	Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and
	variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction,
	feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like
	streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings.
	However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and
	keyword in the previous example). We propose to envision such higher-order
	data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However,
	these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite
	streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor
	analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for
	high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden
	correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor
	analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based
	tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental
	design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation
	accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all
	our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network
	anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation
	networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical
	studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and
	that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study trajectory planning and control in voluntary,
	human arm movements. When a hand is moved to a target, the central
	nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite
	number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position.
	First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination.
	Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements
	and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the
	hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly
	straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis
	of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose
	a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories.
	This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure
	of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change
	of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective
	function CT is defined as follows: \$\$C\_T = \frac{1}{2}{}^t\int\limits\_0^f
	{\sum\limits\_{i = 1}^n {\left( {\frac{{{\text{d}}z\_i }}{{{\text{d}}t}}}
	\right)^2 {\text{d}}t,} } \$\$ where ziis the torque generated by
	the i-th actuator (muslce) out of n actuators, and tfis the movement
	time. Since this objective function critically depends on the complex
	nonlinear dynamics of the musculoskeletal system, it is very difficult
	to determine the unique trajectory which yields the best performance.
	We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with
	which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are
	simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories
	were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations.
	These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is
	planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torquechange
	criterion.},

	Decomposition (SVD), emphasizing initial characterization of the
	data. We describe SVD methods for visualization of gene expression
	data, representation of the data using a smaller number of variables,
	and detection of patterns in noisy gene expression data. In addition,
	we describe the precise relation between SVD analysis and Principal
	Component Analysis (PCA) when PCA is calculated using the covariance
	matrix, enabling our descriptions to apply equally well to either
	method. Our aim is to provide definitions, interpretations, examples,

  abstract = {We introduce Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) for nonlinear
	time series analysis, with applications to learning models of human
	pose and motion from high-dimensional motion capture data. A GPDM
	is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent
	space with associated dynamics, as well as a map from the latent
	space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters
	in closed form by using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamical
	and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model
	for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model.
	We demonstrate the approach and compare four learning algorithms
	on human motion capture data, in which each pose is 50-dimensional.
	Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective
	representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces.},
