Recent technologies in vision sensors are capable of capturing 3D finger positions and movements.
We propose a novel way to control and interact with computers by moving fingers in the air. The positions of fingers are precisely captured by a computer vision device. By tracking the moving patterns of fingers, we can then recognize users' intended control commands or input information.  We demonstrate this human input approach through an example application of handwriting recognition.
By treating the input as a time series of 3D positions, we propose a fast algorithm using dynamic time warping to recognize characters in online fashion. We employ various optimization techniques to recognize in real time as one writes. Experiments show promising recognition performance and speed.
